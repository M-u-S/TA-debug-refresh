## Usage ##
This is a Add-on for Splunk to provide a custom search command called 'refresh'
to reload most of the Splunk config endpoints.

It does not reload `admin/cooked` and `admin/auth-services` be default.

Simply call `| refresh` in the search bar to reload the endpoints. Use `| refresh entity=all` to also reload the splunktcp cooked REST endpoint (can result in data loss!)

Or specify an entity to be reloaded `| reload entity=foo`

## Installation ##
- Install as any other Splunk App

## Debug ##
If needed you can enabled debugging to splunkd.log in the script `refresh.py` by
setting `myDebug='yes'` on line 6
